# minor-project
This is a project that I completed in order to complete a course. I made a working project that included an ardiuno board, moisture sensor, and a water pump. I worte a automatic program in MATLAB that read the sensor using ardiuno board every 5 minutes to check the moisture level in it, and if it was below the specified level, then water pump was triggered and plant was watered.
